Experiments with technology and infrastructure for remote villages

Phase 1 (proposal): Cameroon 134 Village Experiment
Components:
- Village Grid DAO
- Village Grid collection with drones, electrical projects, and other energy/resource/utility technology as one collection
- Teams for each tech type.
- Open Source Knowledge sharing
- Catchy artists and content creators who help knowledge be more translatable
- Solid connection to legacy research and system operation institutions

Basic idea is to capture before and after surveys of each project site using a drone (each drone has an associated NFT).
